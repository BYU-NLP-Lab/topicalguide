NAME
       md5sum - compute and check MD5 message digest

SYNOPSIS
       md5sum [OPTION] [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print  or check MD5 (128-bit) checksums.  With no FILE, or when FILE is
       -, read standard input.

       -b, --binary
              read in binary mode

       -c, --check
              read MD5 sums from the FILEs and check them

       -t, --text
              read in text mode (default)

   The following two options are useful only when verifying checksums:
       --status
              don’t output anything, status code shows success

       -w, --warn
              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The sums are computed as described in RFC  1321.   When  checking,  the
       input  should  be a former output of this program.  The default mode is
       to print a line with checksum, a character  indicating  type  (‘*’  for
       binary, ‘ ’ for text), and name for each FILE.
