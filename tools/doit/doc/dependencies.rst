======================
Dependencies & Targets
======================

`file_dep` (dependencies) and `targets` are optional attributes of a task.

Dependency
  A *file_dep* indicates a file input to the task execution.

Target
  A *target* is the result/output produced by the task execution.

i.e. In a compilation task the source file is a *file_dep*, the object file is a *target*.


.. literalinclude:: tutorial/compile.py


up-to-date
----------

`doit` automatically keeps track of file-dependencies. It saves the signature (MD5) of the dependencies every time the task is completed successfully. In case there is no modification in the dependencies and the targets already exist, it skip the task execution to save time, as it would produce the same output from the previous run.

So if there are no modifications to the dependencies and you run `doit` again. The execution of the task's actions is skipped.


.. code-block:: console

  eduardo@eduardo:~$ doit
  .  compile
  eduardo@eduardo:~$ doit
  -- compile

Note the ``--`` (2 dashes, one space) on the command output on the second time it is executed. It means, this task was up-to-date and not executed.



example - no targets
---------------------

Different from most build-tools dependencies are on tasks not on targets. So `doit` can take advantage of the "execute only if not up-to-date" feature even for tasks that not define targets.

Lets say you work with a dynamic language (python in this example). You don't need to compile anything but you probably wants to apply a lint-like tool (`PyChecker <http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/>`_) to your source code files. You can define the source code as a dependency to the task.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/checker.py

.. code-block:: console

   eduardo@eduardo:~$ doit
   .  checker
   eduardo@eduardo:~$ doit
   -- checker

Note the ``--`` again.



task-dependency
---------------

We have seen only dependencies on files up to now. On `doit` you can also define **task-dependency**. To define a dependency on another task use the task name (whatever comes after ``task_`` on the function name) in the "task_dep" attribute. It is used to enforce tasks are executed on the desired order. By default tasks are executed on the same order as they were defined in the `dodo` file.


.. note::

  A *task-dependency* **only** indicates that another task should be "executed" before itself. The task-dependency might not really be executed if it is *up-to-date*.

.. note::

  *task-dependency* s are **not** used to determine if a task is up-to-date or not. If a task defines only *task-dependency* or no dependencies at all it will always be executed.


This example we make sure we include a file with the latest revision number of the bazaar repository on the tar file.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tar.py

.. code-block:: console

    eduardo@eduardo:~$ doit
    .  version
    .  tar


groups
^^^^^^^

You can define group of tasks by adding tasks as dependencies and setting its `actions` to ``None``.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/group.py

Note that tasks are never executed twice in the same "run".


targets
-------

Targets can be any file path (a file or folder). If a target doesn't exist the task will be executed. There is no limitation on the number of targets a task may define.

Lets take the compilation example again.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/compile.py

If there are no changes in the dependency the task execution is skipped. But if the target is removed the task is also executed again. But only if does not exist. If the target is modified but the dependencies do not change the task is not executed again.

.. code-block:: console

    eduardo@eduardo:~$ doit
    .  compile
    eduardo@eduardo:~$ doit
    -- compile
    eduardo@eduardo:~$ rm main.o
    eduardo@eduardo:~$ doit
    .  compile
    eduardo@eduardo:~$ echo xxx > main.o
    eduardo@eduardo:~$ doit
    -- compile


result-dependency
----------------------

In some cases you can not determine if a task is "up-to-date" only based on some input files, you might need to run an external process to check that. *doit* defines a "result-dependency" to deal with these cases without need to create an intermediate file with the reulsts of the process.

i.e. Suppose you want to send an email everytime you run *doit* on a bazaar repository that contains a new revision number.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/taskresult.py

Note the `result_dep` with the name of the task (version). `doit` will keep track of the output of the task *version* and will execute *send_email* only when the bazaar repository has a new version since last time *doit* was executed.

The "result" from the dependent task compared between different runs is given by its last action. The content for python-action is the value of the returned string. For cmd-actions is the output send to stdout plus stderr.


calculated-dependencies
------------------------

Calculation of dependencies might be an expensive opration, so not suitable to be done on task-generators. For this situation is better to delegate the calculation of dependencies to another task. The task calcutating dependencies must have a python-action returning a dictionary with `file_dep`, `task_dep`, `result_dep`, or another `calc_dep`.

On the example below ``mod_deps`` prints on the screen all direct dependencies from a module. The dependencies itself are calculated on task ``get_dep`` (note: get_dep has a fake implementation where the results are taken from a dict).


.. literalinclude:: tutorial/calc_dep.py


getargs
--------

`getargs` provides a way to use values computed in one task from another task.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/getargs.py


run-once
--------

Sometimes there is no dependency for a task but you do not want to execute it all the time. If you use ``True`` as dependency (in "file_dep") the task will not be executed again after the first successful run. This is mostly used together with targets.

Suppose you need to download something from internet. There is no dependency though you do not want to download it many times.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/download.py

Note that even with *run-once* the file will be downloaded again in case the target is removed.

.. code-block:: console

    eduardo@eduardo:~$ doit
    .  get_pylogo
    eduardo@eduardo:~$ doit
    -- get_pylogo
    eduardo@eduardo:~$ rm python-logo.gif
    eduardo@eduardo:~$ doit
    .  get_pylogo



never-upto-date
-----------------

A dependency (file_dep) value ``False`` can also be used in a dependency list to indicate that task should never be considered up-to-date.

Dependency None
----------------

``None`` values as "file_dep" will just be ignored. This is used when the value is dinamically calculated.



keywords on actions
--------------------

It is common situation to use task information such as *targets*, *dependencies*, or *changed* in its own actions. Note: Dependencies are only *file-dependencies*.

For *cmd-action* you can use the python notation for keyword substitution on strings. The string will contain all values separated by a space (" ").

For *python-action* create a parameter in the function `doit` will take care of passing the value when the function is called. The values are passed as list of strings.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/hello.py



Environment setup
---------------------

Some tasks require some kind of environment setup. Tasks may have a list of "setup" task.

* the setup-task will be executed only if the task is to be executed (not up-to-date)
* setup-tasks are just normal tasks that follow all other task behavior

Task may also define a 'teardown' actions. These actions are executed after all tasks have finished their execution.

Example:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tsetup.py
