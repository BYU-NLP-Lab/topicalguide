\section{Why?}
Topic models are neat... (definition?)
...but their output is hard for humans to digest
Topics aren't isolated entities, but form a network in combination with documents, words, authors, and so on.
This network is implied by a topic model, but generally not made explicit (?)
Experience suggests that an explicit representation of the relationships between all entities modeled and makes topic model output more informative and usable.
[We're in the process of formally validating this claim.]

\section{What?}

Words
Charts
