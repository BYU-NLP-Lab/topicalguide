\begin{abstract}
Though topic models reduce dimensionality, their output is just as large as the
training corpus. Thus, humans' ability to manually assess model quality is
limited. As digitization of historic texts proceeds at breakneck pace,
institutions correspondingly find an increased need for tools such as topic
models to make these texts usable. In response to these twin needs, we present
the \tool, an open-source web application for interactive,
topic-centric exploration and visualization of topic model output. We explain
why such a tool is warranted, what it is capable of, and how to use it to
explore the corpus or topic model of your choice.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Since its introduction, LDA-based topic modeling \cite{blei_latent_2003} has
become standard fare for those wishing to automatically distill large text
collections into something more immediately useful to humans and computers
alike. The usefulness of this sort of dimensionality reduction is widely
acknowledged, and topic models continue to be extended into exciting new
territory.
\cite{wang_continuous_2008,mimno_polylingual_2009,boyd-graber_holistic_2010,brody_unsupervised_2010,he_detecting_2009,yao_efficient_2009}
However, when inferred by means of sampling, these models output a topic
assignment per token, resulting in an output that is a corpus unto itself.
Though the range of possible values is substantially reduced, output size
remains on the same order as input size. Notwithstanding, papers introducing new
topic models often lean heavily on the hope that displaying a few hand-picked
topics will convince others of the model's effectiveness. But the very vastness
of topic model output renders this sort of presentation unconvincing.
Unfortunately, tools for deep understanding of topic model output have thus far
been lacking.

\end{figure*}
Simultaneously, massive digitization efforts by libraries and other institutions
are generating gargantuan quantities of electronic text, increasing demand for tools such as
topic models. Because of their ability to characterize the contents of
corpora, topic models seem to hold great promise for archival
institutions wishing to make their newly-digitized collections accessible to
researchers and the public. However, readily available tools for exploration of 
document collections in terms of topic models have been either unsatisfactory
or nonexistent.

We present the \tool, an open-source\footnote{Licensed under the terms of the Affero
General Public License, version 3.} web application for interactive,
topic-aware exploration and visualization of both document collections and the
topic models inferred on them.\footnote{Further information on the project, including
source code access and a live demonstration server, can be found
at \texttt{\projecturl}.} The \tool{} is an aid both to those who wish to
browse through a corpus and for those who wish to analyze the topic model itself.
We believe that this interactive, topic-aware approach to corpus and model exploration
exposes their characteristics to human comprehension in a way that static visualizations cannot.

In this paper, we will discuss: browsing of topic model output using the \tool{} user interface, as in \cite{gardner_browser_2010};
document metadata; document and topic metrics; a topic-space visualization we call
topic maps; a mechanism for interchangeable topic name schemes; and the data import%TODO Should we call this ``topic maps'' when that name has been used previously?
system. Throughout this paper, examples are taken from a
corpus of State of the Union messages delivered by United States presidents
from 1790 to 2010. This constitutes 223 documents totalling XXXXXXX tokens. %TODO Count tokens

\end{figure*}
\section{Browsing}
All entities explicitly modeled by a basic topic model --- topics, documents,
and words --- are first-class citizens in the \tool, meaning that the user
interface provides specific views for each of these entity types. The topic view
is central to the user experience. A view of the \texttt{programs federal} topic is
rendered in Figure \ref{fig:topic_page}. On the left is a navigation sidebar listing other topics,
with tabs providing links to other views such as \texttt{Attributes}, \texttt{Documents}, and \texttt{Plots}.
The remainder of the page shows statistics about the topic
(\texttt{STATS}); chart, word-cloud, and key-word-in-context representations of top
words (\texttt{TOP WORDS P(W|Z)} / \texttt{WORD CLOUD} / \texttt{TOP WORDS IN CONTEXT}); and
both textual and graphical representations of similar topics (\texttt{SIMILAR
TOPICS} / \texttt{TOPIC MAP}).

The word view is shown in Figure \ref{fig:topic_word}. It presents the user with
a list of contexts in which the word appears, along with the total number of
occurrences, and lists of topics and documents in which the word occurs most
often. 

The document view can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:topic_doc}, showing the content
of the document along with any document metrics that have been computed. By
means of pairwise document metrics, a list of similar documents is shown as
well.

Intuitive hyperlinks make this a true \textit{browsing} tool. Click on the
``economic congress'' node in the topic map and be sent to its topic view
to see how presidents have discussed economic issues. Click on ``billion'' in
the word cloud to see how that word has been used in various addresses (Figure
\ref{fig:topic_word}). Or click on ``Harry\_S.\_Truman\_1.txt'' to see
President Truman's message with words belonging to the ``programs federal''
topic highlighted (Figure \ref{fig:topic_doc}).

%TODO Show words in context in the word view

An important concept used by the \tool{} object model and user interface is the
notion of \textit{datasets} and \textit{analyses}. A dataset is a set of
documents --- a corpus. An analysis is associated with one dataset and
constitutes a set of topics and token-level topic assignments for all of the
documents in that dataset. The analysis concept is useful in allowing for
multiple topic models on a single dataset. For example, it could be useful to
use LDA to infer both a 20-topic model and a 100-topic model on the State of the
Union Addresses dataset.

 \caption{A view of Harry Truman's first State of the Union address, highlighting words belonging to the ``programs federal'' topic.}

\end{figure*}

\section{Document Metadata}
Acknowledging that more is known about most documents than just their content,
the \tool{} provides \textit{document attributes}, a mechanism for association
of arbitrary metadata with documents. This accomodates metadata
provided by a dataset curator, often including facts about document
provenance and author identity. Document attributes also allow for metadata
obtained as part of the output of a model. These attributes can be used to
filter the list of documents, or as axes in charts.

\section{Metrics}
Topic-centric document exploration is enhanced by means of \textit{metrics}.
Metrics are functions that give users additional insight into the nature of
topics or documents. They can be either unary or binary, here called
\textit{pairwise}.\footnote{Pairwise metrics do not necessarily constitute
``metrics'' in the formal sense. We leave it to implementers to determine
whether to satisfy the triangle inequality, etc.} Topic metrics range from
simple metrics, such as the number of word tokens and types labeled with the
topic, to more complicated metrics such as dispersion across documents,
prevailing sentiment, or the semantic coherence of its words \cite{Newman2010}.
Pairwise topic metrics include Pearson correlation on documents and on words.
These are used to automatically display a list of similar topics and to weight
the edges of the graph used to generate ``topic maps'' (discussed further in section
\ref{sec:maps}). Similar to topic metrics, one can also compute document
metrics. Beyond simple metrics like token count in the document, these include
things such as the entropy of the topic distribution of the document \cite{Misra2008}. And as
with topics, we make use of pairwise document metrics such as topic
correlation \cite{Blei2009} to show similar documents.

 \label{fig:chart}
 \caption{Selected topics over time as a percentage of overall tokens.}
\end{figure*}

\section{Plots}
The \tool{} allows users to interactively generate two types of plots. The ﬁrst
shows trends for topics over the values of an attribute -- for example, the year
of an address, or the political party of the president delivering it. This kind
of plot has been used in visualizing topic models almost since their
introduction. These trend plots can be generated over any attribute for any
topic or combination of topics in the corpus. Figure \ref{fig:chart} shows
trends for four chosen topics across the \texttt{year} attribute, giving a view
of topic lifecycles across time as in \cite{Griffiths2004,Wang2006}.

The second type of plot is a scatter plot of topic metrics, which is
particularly suited to discovery of relationships between topic metrics. For
example, we have found that document entropy seems to correlate with the
logarithm of the number of tokens in the topic, and that coherence does not seem
to correlate with any other topic metric yet implemented.



\section{Topic Maps}\label{sec:maps}
With topic-to-topic relationships described by means of pairwise topic metrics,
graph-based visualization of the topic space becomes straightforward. In our
current implementation, we construct a topic graph $G = (N, E)$ as follows:

$N$ is a set of $|T|$ nodes such that
\[\forall_{t\in T} weight(N_{t}) = \tau_{1}(t)\]
and
\[\forall_{t\in T} color(N_{t}) = \tau_{2}(t)\]
where $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ are topic metrics (potentially the same). $E$ is
constructed as a set of $|T|^2$ edges such that
  \[\forall_{(t,u)\in T\times T, t\neq u} weight(E_{t,u}) = \pi(t,u)\]
where $\pi$ is a pairwise topic metric.

We use the Gephi Toolkit\footnote{http://www.gephi.org} to generate such graphs
and render them as images, employing a force-directed layout algorithm to
arrange the nodes so that, generally speaking, nodes joined by edges of higher
weight are closer together, and nodes joined by edges of lower weight are
further apart. In the final rendering of the image, edges are omitted to reduce
visual complexity. However, the distances between nodes are still determined by
the interaction of the layout algorithm and the edge weights.

\section{Topic Name Schemes}
As LDA does not assign names to the topics it generates, automatic generation of
topic names is of interest to researchers wishing to make topic models
human-usable. Research in this area is ongoing \cite{Mei2007,Lau2010}. In order to
facilitate investigations in this area, we equipped the \tool{} with a
fully pluggable topic naming system. Any number of topic name schemes can be
used to produce names for all topics in an analysis. Within the user interface
users can select a name scheme, which is then reflected throughout the
interface. By default we use a concatenation of the two
words with the highest probability for a given topic $z$, but any number of
alternative schemes can be imagined and implemented.%TODO Maybe show TF-ITF?

 \label{fig:build_flowchart}
\end{figure*}
\section{Data Import Backend}
Automatically turning a raw document collection into an interactive browsing
experience requires extensive preprocessing. Documents must be converted into a
representation accepted by the topic model learner. Topics must then be inferred
and model output indexed for quick retrieval by the web front-end.
Additionally, metrics must be computed, topic names generated, and graphs rendered
before they become accessible via the user interface. Unsurprisingly, the dependencies
in the import process form a directed acyclic graph, represented in Figure \ref{fig:build_flowchart}.
In order to make workflows simpler and more efficient, we implemented
the import process as a command-line frontend based on the \texttt{doit}
task automation tool.\footnote{http://doit.sourceforge.net/} This allows full
import of a dataset using a single invocation of the import script.

Enabling the \tool{} to browse a new dataset can be as simple as picking a name
and description, converting the documents to plaintext, placing them in a
directory, and providing a JSON file containing any document metadata. By default,
the \tool{} will automatically invoke MALLET's LDA implementation to train a
topic model \cite{McCallum2002}; however, the import system can also make use of
existing topic model output in the MALLET format. The system also allows all
elements of the pipeline to be overridden, allowing for clean integration with
existing code.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we introduced the \tool{} as a tool for exploration of
topic model output. This serves to improve understanding of both topic models
and text corpora. We briefly described some of the general features of the tool
and proceeded to detail the use of metrics and graphs. We then explained how
new datasets can easily be imported into the tool.
