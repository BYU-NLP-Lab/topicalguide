Discuss with Joey:
code review
removing the metadata types
require document readable name?


TODO:
Add ability to import to detached databases.
Make database importing more efficient.
Refactor code to conform to structure condisive to the next item below.

Take a second look at the import system and determine if it could be broken down in different ways.
    Some of these ways would be to allow the user to do multiple analysis imports on an already imported dataset.
    Running different metrics, even on an as needed basis.
    Why? This may make the Topical Guide more accessible, 
    users can interact with the dataset running metrics/analysis/topic naming on an as needed basis.
    Users should be able to remove a dataset, analysis, metrics, etc.
Update documentation.
Create test case for type autodetect
Add ability for the server to link to an existing dataset in an existing database.

Readup on pythonic documentation (pep-8) and update mine accordingly to prep for code review.
Track down bug in frontend/server that causes dataset to not be loaded for 2D Plots.



Upgrade Mallet/find source code that we changed.
Make output more space efficient with Mallet.




Discussion:
Allow metadata key descriptions.
Remove metadata types altogether and just use a string, but verify types before database insertion?
    Then use Javascript to reconvert those types at user time.
Database: Change Document database model to require readable name.
Feature: Show *Document* readable name and metadata on website in nice human readable format.
How to properly import subdocuments (is it as simple as treating each paragraph as a document?)
    There seems to be a concept that I'm missing.
