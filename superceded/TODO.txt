Discuss with Joey:
code review
removing the metadata types
require document readable name?


TODO:
Refactor code to conform to structure conducive to the next item below.

Add ability to add dataset, remove dataset, add analysis, remove analysis, add metrics, link to database, create database tables.
Update documentation.
Create test case for type autodetect.
Add ability for the server to link to an existing dataset in an existing database.

Readup on pythonic documentation (pep-8) and update mine accordingly to prep for code review.
Track down bug in frontend/server that causes dataset to not be loaded for 2D Plots.



Upgrade Mallet/find source code that we changed.
Make output more space efficient with Mallet.




Discussion:
Allow metadata key descriptions.
Remove metadata types altogether and just use a string, but verify types before database insertion?
    Then use Javascript to reconvert those types at user time.
Database: Change Document database model to require readable name.
Feature: Show *Document* readable name and metadata on website in nice human readable format.
How to properly import subdocuments (is it as simple as treating each paragraph as a document?)
    There seems to be a concept that I'm missing.


Goals:
Optimize pairwise doc correlation. (at 3 min with state of the union)
    
Make join table more explicit to enable batch commits. (analysis import at 2:30 with state of union)
    visualize_wordtoken_topics with wordtoken_id and topic_id
Make sure all 3 of datasets can be imported, no problems with encodings.
Make stopwords and regex removal available.
