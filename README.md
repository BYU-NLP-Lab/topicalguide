# The Topical Guide

Copyright 2010-2015 Brigham Young University

## About

The topical guide is a tool aimed at helping laymen and experts intuitively
navigate the topic distribution produced by a topic model, such as LDA, over a
given dataset.

Learn more by visiting [the wiki](https://github.com/BYU-NLP-Lab/topicalguide/wiki).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Source

Clone the source with the following:
    
    git clone https://github.com/BYU-NLP-Lab/topicalguide.git

Then navigate to the `topicalguide` directory and optionally switch over to the `dev` branch for development.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be easily installed with:

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

If you want to use the word stemmer then run the following:
    
    cd tools/stemmer/
    ./make_english_stemmer.sh

### 3. Create Settings

In order for django to run it needs `settings.py` to be created.
First, copy the template:

    cp topicalguide/settings.py.template topicalguide/settings.py

Second, go to [this website](http://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) to generate your `SECRET_KEY`.

Open `topicalguide/settings.py` in your favorite text editor.  
Insert your generated `SECRET_KEY` where it says

	SECRET_KEY=''

Third, set your database settings. You could use sqlite, which is configured for you. 
If you want to use Postgres there are instructions below for setting it up on Fedora.

Fourth, set `DEBUG = True` to use the developement server.
If DEBUG is set to False then ALLOWED_HOSTS must be set. See Django's documentation for further details.

Optionally, configure other various django options.

### 4. Import a Dataset

You can run (from the project's root directory):
    
    ./default_datasets/import_state_of_the_union.sh
    
or

    python tg.py import default_datasets/state_of_the_union/ --identifier state_of_the_union --public --public-documents
    python tg.py analyze state_of_the_union --number-of-topics 100

For more options on importing see the documentation by running:

    python tg.py -h

### 5. Done!

Start up the development web server with the following command:

    python manage.py runserver

and then open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/.

## POSTGRESQL

It can be tons faster to use postgres. Because it took me a bit of hunting to
get it to behave, here's how to do it on Fedora::

    sudo yum install postgres*
    sudo yum install python-psycopg2

    sudo systemctl enable postgresql.service
    sudo postgresql-setup initdb
    sudo -u postgres createdb topicalguide

In your settings.py you'll then need to switch DBTYPE to 'postgres' and
update the settings for the postgres database. For a local connection, we
prefer to use peer authentication, so we leave the user and password blank.
If you prefer to use md5 authentication, set the user and password
appropriately. Update the name field to 'topicalguide', or whatever you named
the database created for the topical guide.

Once the database is setup run the commands starting at step 4 with the prefix
`sudo -u postgres`.

## Apache

As an example, the following template apache configuration file could be 
filled in and placed in /etc/httpd/conf.d to run your server assuming your 
project is located at /srv/topicalguide::

    ServerAdmin your_admin_email@somewhere.com
    ServerName your.server.com
    ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/your-error_log
    CustomLog /var/log/httpd/your-access_log common
    LogLevel warn

    Alias /scripts /srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/media/scripts/
    Alias /styles /srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/media/styles/
    Alias /site-media /srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/media
    <Directory "/srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/media">
       Require all granted
    </Directory>

    WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
    WSGIScriptAlias / /srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/apache/django.wsgi
    <Directory "/srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/apache">
       Require all granted
    </Directory>

Note that the django.wsgi file we use is included in the repository.
Further information on setting up Django to run with Apache can be found
in the official Django documentation.
