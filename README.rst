About
=====

The topical guide is a tool aimed at helped laymen (and experts) intuitively
naviagate the topic distribution produced by a topic model (such as LDA) for a
given dataset.

Installation
============

1. Clone the source
-------------------

::

   git clone git://github.com/BYU-NLP-Lab/topicalguide.git

2. Install dependencies
-----------------------

You can either use the pip `requirements.txt file`_::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

.. _`requirements.txt file`: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/requirements.html

Or you can install the python dependencies some other way (yum, by hand,
etc.); they're listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

.. include:: requirements.txt
   :literal:

3. Configure local settings
---------------------------

Copy `import_tool/local_settings.py.sample` to
`import_tool/local_settings.py` and make any changes you want. The defaults
should be reasonable::

    cp import_tool/local_settings.py.sample import_tool/local_settings.py

4. Generate the SECRET_KEY
--------------------------

Go to this website to generate your SECRET_KEY 
http://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/

Navigate to topicalguide/topic_modeling/settings.py.  
Insert your generated SECRET_KEY where is says 
	SECRET_KEY=''

Be sure not to commit/push your settings.py file with your SECRET_KEY in it.

5. Create the Database
----------------------

Run::

   python topic_modeling/manage.py syncdb

6. Import a dataset
-------------------

In local settings you can configure what dataset to import (default is the
'state of the union addresses'), and then run `./run_import.py` to run the
import.

7. Done!
--------

Start up the web server with the following command::

   python topic_modeling/manage.py runserver

and then open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/.

Dependencies
-------------

- python
   - django
   - nltk
   - numpy

   [optional]
   - django-extensions
   - gunicorn
   - django-debug-toolbar
   - docopt

- java [for mallet]

POSTGRESQL
==========

It can be tons faster to use postgres. Because it took me a bit of hunting to
get it to behave, here's how to do it on Fedora::

   sudo yum install postgres*
   sudo yum install python-psycopg2

   sudo systemctl enable postgresql.service
   sudo postgresql-setup initdb
   sudo -u postgres createdb topicalguide

In your local_settings.py you'll then need to switch DBTYPE to 'postgres' and
update the settings for the postgres database. For a local connection, we
prefer to use peer authentication, so we leave the user and password blank.
If you prefer to use md5 authentication, set the user and password
appropriately. Update the name field to 'topicalguide', or whatever you named
the database created for the topical guide.

Once the database is setup, you'll need to import the data.
This can be done as follows::

   sudo -u postgres python topic_modeling/manage.py syncdb
   sudo -u postgres python run_import.py

Assuming that everything imported without error,
you are now ready to run the server::

   sudo -u postgres python run_server.py

Apache
======

As an example, the following is the apache configuration file in
/etc/httpd/conf.d which we use on our demo server::

   ServerAdmin jefflund@gmail.com
   ServerName coherence.byu.edu
   ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/coherence-error_log
   CustomLog /var/log/httpd/coherence-access_log common
   LogLevel warn

   Alias /scripts /srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/media/scripts/
   Alias /styles /srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/media/styles/
   Alias /site-media /srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/media
   <Directory "/srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/media">
       Require all granted
   </Directory>

   WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
   WSGIScriptAlias / /srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/apache/django.wsgi
   <Directory "/srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/apache">
       Require all granted
   </Directory>

Note that the django.wsgi file we use is included in the repository.
Further information on setting up Django to run with Apache can be found
in the official Django documentation.
