The Topical Guide
--------------------------------------------

Copyright 2010-2012 Brigham Young University

About
=====

The topical guide is a tool aimed at helping laymen (and experts) intuitively
navigate the topic distribution produced by a topic model (such as LDA) for a
given dataset.

Installation
============

1. Clone the source
-------------------

::

   git clone git://github.com/BYU-NLP-Lab/topicalguide.git

2. Install dependencies
-----------------------

You can either use the pip `requirements.txt file`_::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

.. _`requirements.txt file`: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/requirements.html

Or you can install the python dependencies some other way (yum, by hand,
etc.); they're listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

.. include:: requirements.txt
   :literal:

3. Create settings.py
--------------------------

In order for django to run it needs settings.py to be created.
First, copy the template:
    `cp topic_modeling/settings.py.template topic_modeling/settings.py`

Second, go to this website to generate your SECRET_KEY 
http://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/

Navigate to topicalguide/topic_modeling/settings.py.  
Insert your generated SECRET_KEY where it says

	SECRET_KEY=''

Be sure not to commit/push your settings.py file with your SECRET_KEY in it.

Third, set your database settings. You could use sqlite, which is configured
for you. If you want to use Postgres there are instructions below for seting up on Fedora.

Four, configure the site caching method, otherwise local memory is used by default.

4. Sync the database
--------------------

Run `topic_modeling/manage.py syncdb`. Note that this requires the user to select whether or not
to enter a super user password for the site. Currently it doesn't matter if you select yes or no.

5. Import a dataset
-------------------

Run `./topicalguide.py import default_datasets/state_of_the_union` to run the default import.
Run `./topicalguide.py -h` for more options.
Alternatively you can create your own custom import by inheriting from the `AbstractDataset` 
class in the `import_tool/dataset_classes/abstract_dataset.py` and use the methods available in 
`import_tool/import_utilities.py` to import a dataset, run analyses, or run metrics.

If you want to keep your datasets in the topicalguide directory tree. Put them in a folder called `datasets`, that way git ignores them.

6. Done!
--------

Start up the development web server with the following command::

   python topic_modeling/manage.py runserver

and then open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/.

Dependencies
-------------

See `requirements.txt`

POSTGRESQL
==========

It can be tons faster to use postgres. Because it took me a bit of hunting to
get it to behave, here's how to do it on Fedora::

   sudo yum install postgres*
   sudo yum install python-psycopg2

   sudo systemctl enable postgresql.service
   sudo postgresql-setup initdb
   sudo -u postgres createdb topicalguide

In your settings.py you'll then need to switch DBTYPE to 'postgres' and
update the settings for the postgres database. For a local connection, we
prefer to use peer authentication, so we leave the user and password blank.
If you prefer to use md5 authentication, set the user and password
appropriately. Update the name field to 'topicalguide', or whatever you named
the database created for the topical guide.

Once the database is setup run the commands starting at step 4 with the prefix
`sudo -u postgres`.

Apache
======

As an example, the following template apache configuration file could be 
filled in and placed in /etc/httpd/conf.d to run your server assuming your 
project is located at /srv/topicalguide::

   ServerAdmin your_admin_email@somewhere.com
   ServerName your.server.com
   ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/your-error_log
   CustomLog /var/log/httpd/your-access_log common
   LogLevel warn

   Alias /scripts /srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/media/scripts/
   Alias /styles /srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/media/styles/
   Alias /site-media /srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/media
   <Directory "/srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/media">
       Require all granted
   </Directory>

   WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
   WSGIScriptAlias / /srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/apache/django.wsgi
   <Directory "/srv/topicalguide/topic_modeling/apache">
       Require all granted
   </Directory>

Note that the django.wsgi file we use is included in the repository.
Further information on setting up Django to run with Apache can be found
in the official Django documentation.
