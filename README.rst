About
=====

The topical guide is a tool aimed at helped laymen (and experts) intuitively
naviagate the topic distribution produced by a topic model (such as LDA) for a
given dataset.

Installation
============

1. Clone the source
-------------------

::

   git clone git://github.com/BYU-NLP-Lab/topicalguide.git

2. Install dependencies
-----------------------

You can either use the pip `requirements.txt file`_::
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt

.. _`requirements.txt file`: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/requirements.html

Or you can install the python dependencies some other way (yum, by hand,
etc.); they're listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

.. include:: requirements.txt
   :literal:

3. Configure local settings
---------------------------

Copy `import_tool/local_settings.py.sample` to
`import_tool/local_settings.py` and make any changes you want. The defaults
should be reasonable::

    cp import_tool/local_settings.py.sample import_tool/local_settings.py

4. Create the Database
----------------------

Run::

   python topic_modeling/manage.py syncdb

5. Import a dataset
-------------------

In local settings you can configure what dataset to import (default is the
'state of the union addresses'), and then run `./run_import.py` to run the
import.

6. Done!
--------

Start up the web server with the following command::

   python topic_modeling/manage.py runserver

and then open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/.

POSTGRESQL
==========

It can be tons faster to use postgres. Because it took me a bit of hunting to
get it to behave, here's how to do it on Fedora::

   sudo yum install postgres*
   sudo service postgres initdb
   sudo service postgres start
   sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER
   sudo -u postgres psql
   ## here type `\password $USER` and then type in a new password
   ## then type `\q` to exit 
   createdb topicalguide
   
   ## based off of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL
