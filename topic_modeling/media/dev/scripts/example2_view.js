/* How to make a view in the TopicalGuide.
 * Step 1: Copy and rename this file.
 * Step 2: Change the readableName to the name as you want it displayed to the user.
 * Step 3: Change the class name from ExampleView to a class name you pick that doesn't 
 *         conflict with any others in the project.
 * Step 4: Determine where on the navigation bar your view is put.
 *         [] will put your view right up front
 *         ["Menu"] will put your view under a menu named "Menu"
 *         ["Menu", "SubMenu", "SubSubMenu"] will nest your view accordingly
 * Step 5: Add the javascript file to the views list in root.html.
 * Step 6: By now your view should be fully incorporated into the site.
 *         Add custom functionality, see method details below.

var ExampleView = DefaultView.extend({
    readableName: "Example",
    
    /*
     * Remember that your view automatically comes with the following models:
     * this.dataModel - Use the submitQueryByHash method to get data from the server.
     * this.selectionModel - Bind to this to be notified of different topics, documents, etc. 
     *                       that the user has selected.
     * this.favsModel - Use this to be notified of any changed favorites.
     * this.settingsModel - This is where any settings necessary to recreate what the user sees
     *                      should be stored. ONLY put the minimal needed items in here. The 
     *                      router and other things may set your settings to what they previously
     *                      were so the user doesn't have to reset them every time.
     * 
     * Failure to use the above models may make your view hard to customize and use as a subview.

     * Other Hints:
     * Use the global variable icons (found in view_templates.js) where-ever possible. If an icon needs to be changed across
     * the site it can be done painlessly.
     * Of especial use is icons.loading which you can display while waiting on the server.
     * Also there is a function this.renderError which you can use to have error information
     * displayed automatically.
