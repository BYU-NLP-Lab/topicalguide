Further information, documentation, and a live demo of the code can be found at
the project website: http://nlp.cs.byu.edu/topicalguide.  We choose not to
repeat most of the documentation in the code itself, though we give some simple
instructions on how to run the code below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program requires django, django-admin, matplotlib and numpy to be installed.
django-admin needs to be installed for the django server to run.

Quick Start:

1) Run backend.py as received in the code; it will run MALLET on a very small
example dataset that we distribute with the code, then load the results into
the browser database.
          
2) Run the server with the following command:
python topic_modeling/manage.py runserver

3) Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/
