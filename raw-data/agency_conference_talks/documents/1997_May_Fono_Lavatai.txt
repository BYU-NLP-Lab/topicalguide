TOPIC: agency/seminary

It is a privilege for me to speak to you today. When I was asked to do this, I asked myself, &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; I felt kind of scared. Then in my seminary class a girl gave a thought for opening devotional. She asked, &ldquo;Do you find difficulties in opportunities or opportunities in difficulties?&rdquo; I thought about this, and now I&rsquo;m here!

I moved from Samoa to the United States last summer. I didn&rsquo;t want to leave my island and my friends. Going to a new high school made me very nervous. In spite of being new, I tried out for the girls&rsquo; basketball team. I made it! I love basketball! As you&rsquo;re running down that court, everyone is counting on you to make that basket. When you make it, a feeling of happiness comes to you, and if you don&rsquo;t make it&#151;well, that is a whole different story!

Anyway, I was on the team and couldn&rsquo;t go to seminary because I had practice every day after school, and I had seminary after school as well. I missed seminary for the whole second quarter and forgot all about it.

One day my mom asked me about it. I told her that everything was OK. But she knew what was going on. My seminary teacher had sent her a letter. She told me: &ldquo;Fono, you know that what you are doing is wrong. I&rsquo;m just going to advise you, but it is your decision. Remember, your decision can give you happiness, and it can also put you into a lot of misery.&rdquo;

I thought about this for several weeks and came to my final decision. I decided to quit basketball and go to seminary. I knew that if I chose basketball over seminary it would be pretty sad and embarrassing at seminary graduation. I didn&rsquo;t want to watch others graduate when I couldn&rsquo;t. Maybe that was the misery my mom was talking about. I decided that I should get my priorities straight. Even though I love basketball so much, first things first. I am hoping to make the basketball team next year. As I plan my schedule, I am making sure that I won&rsquo;t have to drop seminary again in order to practice.

Right now I&rsquo;m back in seminary. I have a great teacher, a fun class, and I&rsquo;m very proud of myself for making the right decision. This experience reminds me of a scripture found in Matthew 6:33 [Matt. 6:33]: &ldquo;But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.&rdquo;

In my native language, I would like to bear my testimony. [Sister Lavatai then spoke the italicized text in Samoan.] I know this Church is true. Its doctrines are true. I am grateful for this Young Women program, for it has taught us many things to improve our lives.

I know this gospel is true. It has helped me a lot throughout my life. I know our leaders are here to help us. I love you all. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
