== Not always a speech ==

For more than a century the State of the Union was not delivered as a speech. According to David Mayer, Thomas Jefferson started a long-standing tradition of sending the State of the Union as a written message to Congress instead of delivering it in person as a speech.  This practice, meant to reinforce the constitutional separation of powers, was respected for more than a century until Woodrow Wilson.<ref>David Mayer (1995) [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/081391485X The Constitutional Thought of Thomas Jefferson], pp. 235-236.</ref>
