/****** How to make a view in the TopicalGuide ******
 * 
 * Step 1:
 * Copy and rename this file.
 * 
 * Step 2:
 * Change the readableName to the name as you want it displayed to the user.
 * Then change the shortName to be a url friendly name with no spaces,
 * no special characters ('_' is okay), and all lowercase; this is the name other 
 * views can reference your view by for navigation purposes. This name 
 * must be unique.
 * 
 * Step 3:
 * Change the class name from ExampleView to a class name you pick that doesn't 
 * conflict with any others in the project.
 * 
 * Step 4:
 * Determine where on the navigation bar your view is put.
 * [] will put your view name directly on the menu bar
 * ["Menu"] will put your view under a menu named "Menu"
 * ["Menu", "SubMenu", "SubSubMenu"] will nest your view accordingly
 * 
 * Step 5:
 * Add the javascript file to the views list in visualize/templates/root.html.
 * 
 * Step 6:
 * By now your view should be fully incorporated into the site.
 * Add custom functionality, and learn about provided functionality below.

/**
 * Remember that your view automatically comes with the following models:
 * 
 * this.dataModel
 * Use the submitQueryByHash method to get data from the server.
 * 
 * this.selectionModel
 * Bind to this to be notified of different topics, documents, etc. 
 * that the user has selected.
 * 
 * this.favsModel
 * Use this to be notified of any changed favorites.
 * 
 * this.settingsModel
 * This is where any settings necessary to recreate what the user sees
 * should be stored. ONLY put the minimal needed items in here. The 
 * router and other things may set your settings to what they previously
 * were so the user doesn't have to reset them every time.
 * 
 * this.viewModel
 * Use this to navigate to other views. Set the "currentView"
 * to be the "shortName" of the view you want to navigate to.
 * 
 * Failure to use the above models may make your view less user-friendly
 * and result in odd behaviors.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Other built-in functionality:
 * 
 * this.el
 * Your view's root DOM element.
 * 
 * this.$el
 * Your view's root element wrapped by jquery.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Function naming conventions:
 * Use "render" to indicate that the view is being built from scratch, over-writing
 * the existing content.
 * Use "update" to indicate that content already on the screen is being updated.
 * Use "click", "change", etc. to indicate that the function is responding to events.

 * Other Hints:
 * 1. Use the global variable tg.icons (found in view_templates.js) where-ever possible.
 *    If an icon needs to be changed across the site it can be done painlessly.
 *    Of especial use is icons.loading which you can display while waiting on the server.
